/* 
!WHAT IS A CLOSURE? 

!CODE OUT AN EXAMPLE CLOSURE
*/

//*1st: 
    //A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has close or A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
    //It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
    //Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to associate data (the object's properties) with one or more methods.
    //In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

//*2nd: 
/* 
* There is a single lexical environment that is shared by the three functions: counter.increment, counter.decrement, and counter.value.
* The shared lexical environment is created in the body of an anonymous function, which is executed as soon as it has been defined (also known as an IIFE)
* The lexical environment contains two private items: a variable called privateCounter, and a function called changeBy
* You can't access either of these private members from outside the anonymous function. Instead, you can access them using the three public functions that are returned from the anonymous wrapper.
*Those three public functions are closures that share the same lexical environment. Thanks to JavaScript's lexical scoping, they each have access to the privateCounter variable and the changeBy function.

    let counter = (function() {
      let privateCount = 0;
      function changeBy(val) {
        privateCount += val

        increment: function() {
          changeBy(1)
        },

    - A closure is an inner function that has access to the scope of an enclosing function
    -A closure has access to variables in 3 separate scopes: 
          1. Variables in its own scope (scope of the inner function)
          2. Variables in the scope of the outer function.
          3. Variables in the the global scope. 

        -Closure also has access to: 
          1. Its own parameters.
          2. Parameters of the outer function(s)
